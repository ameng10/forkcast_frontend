# User Journey

In one typical session, a user opens the app, enters an owner ID (for example, “user:Alex”), and defines a custom “energy” metric before recording a quick check-in for the morning; they then log breakfast (oatmeal and berries), see it appear in their meal history with the time, and click the entry to auto-fill the edit panel to tweak a note. Later that day, they return to Quick Check-Ins, adjust the value and fix the time on the most recent entry, and immediately see the update reflected in the list. That evening, they switch to Personal Q&A, add a fact like “I feel great after oatmeal,” and ask, “What meals helped my energy today?” to get a concise answer that references their fact and logged breakfast. This rough prototype demonstrates the core journey end-to-end—setting an owner, defining/recording/editing quick check-ins, submitting/viewing/editing meals, and asking questions influenced by ingested personal facts.
