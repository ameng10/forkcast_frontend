# User Journey

Anthony, a dedicated athlete, begins his experience on Forkcast by entering his name in the User field and activating his session. With his profile set, he navigates to the Quick Check-Ins page, where he logs daily metrics such as weight, sleep, and mood. Each check-in is instantly visible in his Recent Check-Ins list, where Anthony can easily edit or delete entries, filter by metric, group by day, and sort his data for better insight into his progress.

Turning his attention to nutrition, Anthony visits the Meals page to log his meals throughout the day. He selects the meal type, sets the date and time, and adds foods like “Chicken, Rice, Broccoli,” along with any relevant notes. Submitted meals appear in the Your Meals list, where Anthony can edit or delete them as needed, and use filters or grouping to review his eating habits over time.

When Anthony has questions about his training or nutrition, he heads to the Personal Q&A page. Here, he asks questions such as “What should I eat after a long run?” and receives AI-powered answers, which he can revisit later. At the end of the week, Anthony reviews his Weekly Summary, exploring trends and highlights in his check-ins and meals, and comparing his progress across different weeks. The app’s fun background, intuitive navigation, and responsive design make it easy for Anthony to stay engaged and on track with his goals.
